    "In this post we will understand and implement the components of the modern object detection model Faster-RCNN. Object detectors involve many parts and\n",
    "it can be difficult to follow the code in the open implementations available. Here we will give a clear layout of of such a model. This post is divided into two parts. In this first one, we will construct the Faster-RCNN network and several of it's components. This will allow us to perform inference using the pretrained weights available from <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md\">Facebook's Detectron</a>, which will help us understand how that object-detection framework works. In the  second part of the post, we will actually train the network ourselves and understand the steps involved in that process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will take certain components for granted - NMS, bounding box transformations, ROI-Align, and the proposal layer. For an explanation of how these work please consult the papers and the full code repo. The focus here is more on how the pieces fit together."

    "<h3> The Two Stages </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Faster-RCNN family of detectors works in two stages. The first stage, the Region Proposal Network (RPN), outputs box regions and their associated 'objectness' score (i.e., object vs no object). These proposals are filtered, then used to crop features from the top-level of the backbone feature extractor (e.g., Resnet-50). This process of feature cropping was done by ROI-pooling in the original Faster-RCNN, or more recently, using ROI-Align in Mask-RCNN. The second stage, the Faster-RCNN network, takes these cropped features and refines the initial proposals of RPN, along with predicting the probability of the object class. The figure below from the Faster-RCNN paper illustrates this two-stage process:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Faster-RCNN version with the Resnet feature extractor (or backbone), RPN operates on the final convolutional layer of the C4 block [3]. ROI-align is performed on the C4 features and those pooled features are first fed through the C5 block and the average pool of Resnet. These last two operations replace the fully-connected layers of VGG in the original application of Resnet to object-detection [3]. After that, the Faster-RCNN network predicts bounding-boxes and classes.\n",
