# Mask-RCNN implementation in PyTorch

Utils are mostly from Facebook's detectron. The proposal layer and ROI-Align layer are adapted from detectorch (see references below).

# Completed
- bounding box inference using pretrained Detectron weights

# To-Do
- batch inference
- evaluation
- training
- masks
